/// <summary>
/// Watches the live-stack frame stream and, when auto-refocus is OFF,
/// raises a "refocus suggested" advisory based on the rolling HFR
/// trend instead of a fixed threshold. The user can refocus by hand
/// (manual focuser) or trigger AF manually, then dismiss the chip.
///
/// Why this exists alongside <see cref="LiveStackTriggersService"/>:
/// LSTR-3 auto-fires the AF service when the user has wired a motor
/// AND enabled RefocusEnabled in the rig. That covers the "I trust
/// the motor" path. This service covers the "I have a manual focuser
/// (or have RefocusEnabled = false)" path, where Polaris cannot move
/// the focuser itself but can still tell the user when stars start
/// trending bad. Pure observational, no actuation.
///
/// Detection is by trend, not by threshold. We keep the last N HFR
/// samples (rolling window), compute the linear-regression slope vs
/// frame index, and fire only when the slope is positive AND the
/// rolling mean is meaningfully above the baseline (5th percentile
/// of the last 20 valid samples). This filters out seeing-driven
/// jitter (oscillates around a mean) while catching systematic drift
/// (trends in one direction).
///
/// Secondary signal: a >30% drop in detected star count, but ONLY
/// when the HFR is also elevated above baseline. A star-count drop on
/// its own does not fire — passing clouds / poor transparency dim out
/// the faint stars without affecting focus, so the HFR of the bright
/// stars that survive stays flat. Real focus drift bloats every star,
/// so the count drop comes paired with rising HFR; that pairing is
/// what this trigger looks for, which keeps cloud cover from being
/// mistaken for a focus problem.
///
/// Frame handler is awaited sequentially inside
/// <see cref="LiveStackingService.AddFrameAsync"/>, but the work
/// done here is microseconds (no I/O, no plate solve) so it doesn't
/// throttle the capture loop the way LSTR-3 can.
